System & Rules
{% endsectionHeader %}

Lancer describes itself as a “mud and lasers”, which I think fits. It’s a mix of mythic fantasy, gritty mech fighting, and strange scifi concepts.

Mechanically, the game splits into out-of-mech and in-mech play.

Out of combat, Lancer is very rules-light. It is significantly simpler than systems like DnD. Most actions are resolved with straightforward dice rolls, with a lot of room for player agency.

On the other hand, combat is more complex. Mech combat is tactical, on a hex grid, and can have a fair few interacting systems.

It isn’t overwhelming, but it is more involved than standard 5E combat. Thankfully, there’s a great site called comp/con that can really help!

Additionally, the system really rewards teamwork. There’s a lot of room to play a dedicated frame for helping allies, and many mechs directly compensate for others’ weaknesses. There’s room to play a teleporter tossing your allies across the field, or a spotter calling shots for a Gundam. Or, just punch things with a very large metallic fist.

Setting
{% endsectionHeader %}

Lancer is set in the far future, after humanity has survived and rebuilt from multiple near-apocalypses. For the most part, these are also our own fault. There are no evil aliens to blame, either, for the most part.

Most of Human space is within [Union](/documents/internal/union/). Union is an idealistic, socialist, interstellar government that genuinely strives to do good. Though it often stumbles due to scale, bureaucracy, and a legacy from its imperialistic past.

Union is not the only power in the galaxy, however. Massive [megacorporations](/documents/internal/corpos/), while technically part of Union, constantly vie for influence and control. The Karrakin Trade Baronies are nominally a constituent member as well, but some of their noble houses flaunt the Pillars. The galaxy is large, pirates, lost colonies, would be despots, cults, and stranger things abound.

This is where the players come in.

You are [Lancers](/documents/internal/lancers/), elite mech pilots, a mix of ace fighter pilots and DnD heroes. Lancers are deployed where situations are too volatile, sensitive, or dangerous for ordinary forces, or were Union can’t afford to deploy real armies. As Union prefers to take a light hand, you’ll often be alone or with only minimal support.

{% sectionHeader "Campaign" %}
General Overview
{% endsectionHeader %}

For an in-universe briefing, go here: {TODO}.

The start of the campaign will be set on a recently recontacted world, [Reihenstadt](/documents/external/reihenstadt/).

Originally founded by a previous Union government, Reihenstadt’s blink gate failed hundreds of years ago, which led to the planet diverging culturally and morally from the wider Union.

After rising tensions during reintegration, the Union administrator of the planet, Franz von Coln, disappeared without a trace.

The players are Lancers, a mix of ones from Union as a whole and a few locals. Your initial task will be assist [OVERSIGHT](/documents/internal/Oversight/) in the investigation of von Coln. There's also been reports of pirate raids, blink gate outages, and political intrigue that Union wants you to look into.

{% sectionHeader "Campaign" %}
Tone and Inspirations
{% endsectionHeader %}

I think our group is never going to be too serious, but I’d like the campaign to feel grounded in the setting.

It’s fine (and encouraged!) for characters to be somewhat strange, have funny backstory elements, and be weird! I’m not expecting a gritty story about war and loss, but I want it to feel like everyone is part of a cohesive world.

The same goes for the general tone of the campaign. I love funny elements and role play, but I also want there to be some moments of heavier tension.

Inspirations:

* SCP
* Machineries of Empire
* Control
