System & Rules
{% endsectionHeader %}

Lancer describes itself as a “mud and lasers”, which I think fits. It’s a mix of mythic fantasy, gritty mech fighting, and strange scifi concepts.

Mechanically, the game splits into out-of-mech and in-mech play.

Out of combat, Lancer is very rules-light. It is significantly simpler than systems like DnD. Most actions are resolved with straightforward dice rolls, with a lot of room for player agency.

On the other hand, combat is more complex. Mech combat is tactical, on a hex grid, and can have a fair few interacting systems.

It isn’t overwhelming, but it is more involved than standard 5E combat. Thankfully, there’s a great site called comp/con that can really help!

Additionally, the system really rewards teamwork. There’s a lot of room to play a dedicated frame for helping allies, and many mechs directly compensate for others' weaknesses. There’s room to play a teleporter tossing your allies across the field, or a spotter calling shots for a Gundam. Or, just punch things with a very large metallic fist.

Setting
{% endsectionHeader %}

Lancer is set in the far future, after humanity has survived and rebuilt from multiple near-apocalypses. For the most part, these are also our own fault. There are no evil aliens to blame, either, for the most part.

Most of the Humanity is within Union (space EU with better morals). Union is an idealistic, socialist, interstellar government that genuinely strives to do good. Though it often stumbles due to scale, bureaucracy, and a legacy from its imperialistic past.

Union is not the only power in the galaxy. Massive megacorporations, while technically part of Union, constantly vie for influence and control.

This is where the players come in.

You are Lancers, elite mech pilots, a mix of ace fighter pilots and DnD heroes. Lancers are deployed where situations are too volatile, sensitive, or dangerous for ordinary forces, or were Union can’t afford to deploy real armies. As Union prefers to take a light hand, you’ll often be alone, or with minimal support.

General Idea
{% endsectionHeader %}

For an in universe briefing, go here {insert link}

The start of the campaign will be set on a recently recontacted world, Reihenstadt.

Originally founded by a prior Union government, Reihenstadt's blink gate failed hundreds of years ago, which led to them diverging culturally and morally.

After rising tensions during reintegration, the Union administrator of the planet, Fran von Koln, disappeared without a trace.

The players are Lancers, a mix of ones from Union as a whole and a few locals.
