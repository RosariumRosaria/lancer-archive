{% sectionHeader "LANCER INTAKE QUESTIONNAIRE" %}
{% endsectionHeader %}

Please keep the following questions in mind for creating a character.

You don't need to fill them all out one by one, these are mostly meant to inspire you.

Your character should be able to answer most of these, but they can also develop over time.

<div class="card">
{% sectionHeader "History and Overview" %}
{% endsectionHeader %}

**Who are you? What are you like?**
<span class="guidance">What is your personality? What does your character's like/dislike.</span>

<span class="guidance">How old are you? What do you look like? Are you a baseline human, or do you have some genetic tampering/drift/machine parts?</span>

**Where are you from?**
<span class="guidance">You do not need to specify a specific planet, a general *vibe* is enough.</span>

<span class="guidance">The galaxy is big. We can either find an existing world that fits, or create something new.</span>

**What is your background?**
<span class="guidance">You have a fair few options, you could be a cowboy, bounty hunter, knight, corporate asset, mechanic, hacker, or something stranger.</span>
<span class="guidance">The backgrounds in COMP/CON might help here.</span>

<div class="card">
{% sectionHeader "Battlefield Role" %}
{% endsectionHeader %}

**What role do you play on the battlefield?**
<span class="guidance">This is roughly equivalent to your class in DnD, the frames and talents in COMP/CON might help guide you.</span>

**Examples:**

- Hacking enemy frames with electronic warfare?
- Providing supportive fire, with lasers, missles, railguns, or fire?
- Acting as a shield for your allies?
- A skirmishing darting across the field?
- Providing repairs and assitance to your allies?
- Laying down mines, holograms, or some other form of area control?
- <span class="horus">No maze is more terrible than yours. We should weep, but with joy, or sorrow?</span>
- Providing information with advanced scouting systems?
- Wielding a massive sword, hammer, or drill in meele?
- Some other role?
