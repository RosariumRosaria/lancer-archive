Skip Gate Down
{% endsectionHeader %}

### Objective

Following disruption to Skip Gate *Alpspitze* (lesser-class blink gate), ALPHA team was deployed to investigate and restore operational status.

### Summary

ALPHA team deployed via unmanned dropship to the structure’s surface and initiated uplink from the primary black-box telemetry store.

Telemetry indicates interference consistent with GOI Horizon. Hostile frames were engaged and neutralized during the operation, resulting in minor secondary damage to *Alpspitze*.

### Outcome

Skip Gate access restored. Sustained damage limits jump-window tolerance. Repairs are ongoing.

### Personnel

- **Pilot:** Romeo  
  **STATUS:** Unwounded

- **Pilot:** Val  
  **STATUS:** Wounded (cosmetic)

- **Pilot:** Karl  
  **STATUS:** Wounded (augmentics required)

### Assets

- **CALLSIGN:** HAWK-3  
  **TYPE:** IPS-N BLACKBEARD  
  **STATUS:** Operational (moderate damage)

- **CALLSIGN:** MIRAGE-1  
  **TYPE:** SSC METALMARK  
  **STATUS:** Disabled (reactor breach)

- **CALLSIGN:** BULLWARK-2  
  **TYPE:** IPS-N DRAKE  
  **STATUS:** KIA, Recovered from Snapshot

### Assessment

Overall, ALPHA team performance is acceptable. While minor, damage to *Alpspitze* could have been avoided; personnel are remanded to secondary training for corrective review.

Continue to monitor GOI Horizon activity for further disturbances.
