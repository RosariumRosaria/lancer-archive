{% sectionHeader "Oversight" %}
Watchdog for the Reintegration of Reihenstadt.
{% endsectionHeader %}

### History

The early reunification period was marked by persistent friction between Union standards and the cultural dispositions of Reihenstadt. Efforts to improve adherence to the Pillars were frequently met with resistance.

It was feared that this resistance risked jeopardizing the project of Reintegration altogether. This was of particular concern given Reihenstadt's SecComm origins.

In an effort to remedy this, OVERSIGHT was established in 4992u as a joint initiative between Administrator Franz von Coln, contacts within Central Committee, and the integration of {% redact 'Apotropia', 3 %}, a prior Heimkrone agency.

OVERSIGHT's mandate was corrective and advisory. It was to observe, advise, and intervene only where excess or neglect threatened the reunification project or the wellbeing of the populace.

Alongside its regular duties, OVERSIGHT assumed responsibility for the remaining operations of {% redact 'Apotropia', 3 %}, most notably the management of defunct SecComm facilities in system. Particularly those associated with {% redact 'paracausal disposal and containment', 3 %}.

  Excerpt from Administrator von Coln
  {% endsectionHeader %}

  I wish to remind all members of OVERSIGHT that your mandate is not to rule or to punish.

  Restraint is essential. Any other course risks reproducing the failures of SecComm.

  Our choice of name is deliberate. OVERSIGHT are to be neither rulers nor jailors.

  Whether stemming from Union, Heimkrone, or even my own office, OVERSIGHT must act as a check when authority steps beyond its mandate.

### Structure

Most of OVERSIGHT’s mandate is executed through its field teams.

- **Response teams** are composed of soldiers, covert operatives, and Lancers tasked with direct intervention and rapid response.

- **Civic teams** pursue resolution through legal, academic, and cultural channels. These include lawyers, historians, and educators assigned to documentation, arbitration, and long-term stabilization efforts.

- **Operations teams** are responsible for staffing and maintaining OVERSIGHT’s facilities, archives, and logistical infrastructure.

Each field team is assigned an Overseer, responsible for issuing mission directives and providing operational support.

Overseers are additionally required to convene at OVERSIGHT Committee meetings and to report to designated stakeholders within Central Committee and Heimkrone.
