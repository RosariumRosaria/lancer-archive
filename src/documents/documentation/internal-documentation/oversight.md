{% sectionHeader "OVERSIGHT" %}
Watchdog for the Reintegration of Reihenstadt.
{% endsectionHeader %}

### History

OVERSIGHT was founded during the early reunification period on Reihenstadt amid persistent friction between Union standards and the culture of Reihenstadt.

Efforts to improve adherence to the Pillars were frequently met with resistance. It was feared that this resistance risked jeopardizing the project of reintegration altogether. This concern was heightened by Reihenstadt’s SecComm origins. When local officials learned of the revolution that established ThirdComm, negotiations nearly collapsed entirely.

Tensions reached a boiling point when Harrison Armory intervened, offering to charter the planet given their shared origins. To this day, they maintain substantial holdings throughout the planet. To avoid complete disaster, OVERSIGHT was established in 4992u as a joint initiative between Administrator Franz von Coln, contacts within the Central Committee, and the integration of {% redact "Apotropia", 3 %}, a prior Heimkrone agency.

OVERSIGHT’s mandate was primarily conciliatory in nature. It was tasked with observing, advising, and intervening only where excess or neglect threatened the reunification project or the well-being of the populace.

Interpretations of this mandate have evolved over time. Today, OVERSIGHT maintains a small armed force, which partners with local units for crisis management and defense against local militant groups.

In recent years, OVERSIGHT has assumed responsibility for the remaining operations of {% redact "Apotropia", 3 %}, most notably the management of defunct SecComm facilities within the system. Of particular note are those associated with {% redact "paracausal disposal and containment", 3 %}.

  Excerpt from Administrator von Coln

  I wish to remind all members of OVERSIGHT that your mandate is not to rule.

  Restraint is essential. Any other course risks reproducing the failures of SecComm.

  Our choice of name is deliberate. OVERSIGHT are to be neither rulers nor jailors.

  Whether stemming from Union, Heimkrone, or even my own office, OVERSIGHT is to act as a check when authority steps beyond its mandate.

### Structure

Most of OVERSIGHT’s mandate is executed through its field teams.

- **Response teams** are composed of soldiers, covert operatives, and [Lancers](/documents/internal/lancers/) tasked with direct intervention and rapid response.

- **Civic teams** pursue resolution through legal, academic, and cultural channels. These include lawyers, historians, and educators assigned to documentation, arbitration, and long-term stabilization efforts.

- **Operations teams** are responsible for staffing and maintaining OVERSIGHT’s facilities, archives, and logistical infrastructure.

Each field team is assigned an Overseer, responsible for issuing mission directives and providing operational support.

Overseers are additionally required to convene at OVERSIGHT Committee meetings and to report to designated stakeholders within Central Committee and Heimkrone.

### Duties

OVERSIGHT has grown to have a broad portfolio of responsibilities. A non-exhaustive list follows.

- Most summits between Union officials and Heimkrone have a Civic team assigned.

- Given its substantial holdings, it additionally acts as first responders in crises, whether natural or human.

- Most extant SecComm installations have fallen under its purview.

- OVERSIGHT maintains several liaisons with the Kalenderkarte Charter.

- Defense and maintenance of Alpspitze has been transferred to the organization in recent years.
