{% sectionHeader "What is a Lancer?" %}
Buckle Up, Space Cowboy
{% endsectionHeader %}

Across the galaxy, “lancer” has become a catch-all name for exceptionally daring and skilled mech pilots, similar to the flying aces of the past. Not all pilots are lancers – most are just good at what they do – but all lancers are pilots.

Nowhere is “lancer” considered an official rank or classification. Lancers are set apart by ability, talent, training, luck, skill, reputation, or some combination of these qualities; they aren’t qualified as lancers by any medal, certification, or promotion. It’s simply an appellation given to exceptional pilots based on time in the saddle and performance in the field.

### Who are you?

Your character in the world of Lancer is a mechanized cavalry pilot of particular note – a lancer. Whatever the mission, whatever the terrain, whatever the enemy, your character is the one who is called in to break the siege or hold the line. When the drop klaxons sound, it’s up to them to save the day. Your lancer hails from a world and culture of your choice, but is human.

They might come from Earth – or Cradle, as it is now called – but to hail from Earth in the age of Union is exceedingly rare. No, it is far more likely that your pilot hails from somewhere in the vastness of the human diaspora. In Lancer, it has been millennia since we left Earth, and most of humanity lives among the stars in our arm of the Milky Way. This humanity is familiar and strange in equal measure. As far as we know, the only sentient, sapient beings in our stellar neighborhood are other humans, but don’t take this as a limitation – there are many roads to becoming a lancer.

Your character might be the product of significant technological and capital investment on the part of their employers; or, they could be a born prodigy – a wunderkind who commands a mech with innate grace and ability, perhaps discovered by a secretive recruiter. Your character might be a lucky conscript – a battle-proven draftee who managed to survive their first drop, promoted by desperate commanders looking for a hero. They could also be the scion of an ancient, atemporal monarchy, destined to inherit the chassis of their polypatriarch. Your character could be a jaded volunteer from a Union liberator team, motivated by a closely-guarded ember of hope for a better future; or an anointed Loyal Wing of the Albatross; or a facsimile of a long-dead pilot, grown in batches of thousands; a spacer who has spent too long listening to the deep whispers of the void.

Whatever led your character to the cockpit of their mech, they are the sum of many parts: enhanced through a combination of training, natural skill, battle‐field experience, and neural or physical augmentation, a lancer is the equivalent of a knight of old, a flying ace, or another class of elite warrior.
