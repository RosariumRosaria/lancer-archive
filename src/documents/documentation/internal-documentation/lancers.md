Across the galaxy, “lancer” has become a catch-all name for exceptionally daring and skilled mech pilots, similar to the flying aces of the past. Not all pilots are lancers – most are just good at what they do – but all lancers are pilots.

Nowhere is “lancer” considered an official rank or classification. Lancers are set apart by ability, talent, training, luck, skill, reputation, or some combination of these qualities; they aren’t qualified as lancers by any medal, certification, or promotion. It’s simply an appellation given to exceptional pilots based on time in the saddle and performance in the field.
