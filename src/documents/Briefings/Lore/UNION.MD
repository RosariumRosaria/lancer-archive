## Union, and the Galaxy:
#### Choke the stars with the living

### State of the world:

It is 5016u, and the galaxy is home to trillions. At the core of humanity’s territory there is a golden age, but outside of this newly won utopia the revolutionary project continues.

### What is Union:

Union is a new kind of utopia. A new state – communal and post-capital – for a New Humanity. Union was born from the ashes and ice of the Fall: the collapse that felled Old Humanity, boiling Cradle and withering her colonies entirely. Though it has been thousands of years since Union was founded – and thousands more since the Fall – New Humanity knows only one truth among ten thousand unknowns: if we are to survive, then we must come together in solidarity and mutual aid.

### Okay, but are they actually evil:

No, but they can be.

Despite Union’s conviction – and despite its successes so far – the sheer size of this collective project is daunting. Union is distant to most people: fictionalized in omninet dramas and novels; dreamed about by children and wanderers; hailed as the promised kingdom or damned as the pit by religions across the galaxy. 

For all its authority, Union prefers to rule from a distance. Few have ever seen one of Union’s administrators, let alone suffered one of its naval campaigns. For those who have never seen its flag, Union is all but a myth; for those whose skies have been darkened by Union’s ships, the hegemony may have brought liberty – but it brought death first.

Union was not always as egalitarian as it is now; for thousands of years prior to the establishment of the Third Committee, it was an empire in all but name. This was the age of the Second Committee – SecComm.

Under SecComm, Union advanced humanity’s diaspora as a glacier scours the earth, flattening cultures left by Old Humanity, societies built by FirstComm, and all whose interpretation of Union’s founding tenets diverged from SecComm’s dogmatic proscriptions.
