### Background

Raised in the shadow of her father, a former Interim Administrator of Reihenstadt, Chen demonstrated early ambition and academic focus.

After completing her doctorate in Applied Paracausal Studies, Chen formally severed familial and civilian affiliations and transferred into OVERSIGHT service. Records indicate the transition was voluntary and expedited.

Chen has served continuously as an Overseer since shortly after Reihenstadt’s reintegration with Union authority. Her early assignments within the organization focused on {% redact "anomalous material decommissioning", 2 %}, as part of post-isolation remediation efforts on the Night Side.
