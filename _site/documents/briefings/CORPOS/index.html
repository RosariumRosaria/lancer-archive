<h2>IPS-Northstar</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">
Your friend in an unfriendly sea.</p>
</p>
    </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>IPS-Northstar (IPS-N) was created from the merger of two civilian interstellar freight and transportation companies, Interplanetary Shipping and Northstar. The resulting firm IPS-N is a titanic entity – one of the first corpro-states – with a virtual monopoly over interplanetary and interstellar shipping. Other firms exist, but their gross fleet strength is but a shadow of IPS-N’s fleets of tankers, haulers, freighters, and intergate/interstellar liners. Wherever goods and raw materials need to be moved, you can bet a crew in IPS-N uniforms will be there.</p>
<h3>Frames</h3>
<p>The corporation sports a range of versatile, durable, and modular frames that place equal priority on weapons and engineering systems.</p>
<p>IPS-N mechs are a good choice for pilots who want a tough chassis that’s built for close quarters and melee combat situations, such as when the possibility of breaching a ship hull is on the table. IPS-N chassis are sturdy, meant to take as much damage as they deal – and then some.</p>

<h2>Smith-Shimano Corpro</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">
&quot;You only need one.</p>
</p>
    </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The second most powerful corpro-state in the galaxy. Unlike Harrison Armory and IPS-N, it holds little physical territory and doesn’t practice colonial missions in the traditional sense. SSC’s physical holdings are dwarfed by its omninet presence and its ubiquity across the Cosmopolita and Diaspora. They have a large focus on biotech, including medicine, genetic engineering, and body modification.</p>
<p>SSC’s goal is to produce best-fit genetic material for the corpro’s big-manna buyers: colony firms looking to license bespoke populations for as-yet-unexploited worlds.</p>
<h3>Frames</h3>
<p>Smith-Shimano frames reflect the corpro-state’s pedigree and its agile, adaptable business model. They are built not to take hits – though they’re resilient enough – but to avoid them entirely. SSC designs emphasize mobility and sleek profiles, precisely tuned to land not the hardest hit, but the most accurate. Economy, precision, and singularity is the name of the game for this manufacturer: why fire a thousand rounds when one can be just as effective?</p>
<p>The mechs developed by SSC are known for their license exclusivity, appealing silhouette, and exacting design. SSC mechs are fast, agile, flexible, and often able to turn invisible.</p>

<h2>Harrison Armory</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">
Superior, by Design.</p>
</p>
    </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The premier manufacturer of weapons and weapon platforms in the galaxy. It is one of the three largest corpro-states that dictate the consumption habits of the Diaspora and Cosmopolita; unlike the others, the Armory is a major and overt participant in galactic politics, pursuing an expansive imperial project that is reined in by only Union and the Karrakin Trade Baronies.</p>
<h3>Frames</h3>
<p>By necessity of Harrison Armory’s imperial aims, its frames tend to be sturdy. More than that, Armory mechs are built to ensure overwhelming performance, embodying dominance and power in their brutal, geometric aesthetics. The fulfillment of that desire requires tremendous power, skill, and material strength.</p>
<p>Harrison Armory licenses are perfect for pilots looking to field durable frontline mechs equipped with the most advanced weapons technology available. They are the most advanced machines in the business, equipped with powerful reactors that provide excellent heat management and enable the use of high-tech energy weapons.</p>

<h2>HORUS</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">
<span class="horus">WELCOME, PILOT. STAY AWHILE?</span></p>
</p>
    </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>HORUS is an oddity among the various pan-galactic corpro-states, outfitters, and manufacturers. Operating in a gray legal state between harmless omninet communes, open-source fabrication collaboratives, black-market printers, and deeper, more esoteric collectives, HORUS is counted among the Big Four not due to its influence on galactic politics, but because of its ubiquitous coverage: one can be certain that wherever there is omninet, HORUS is either there or soon to follow.</p>
<h3>Frames</h3>
<p>HORUS frames are esoteric constructs, specialized to control the battlefield – hacking, inflicting statuses, and dealing heat. They vary wildly in form, function, and design.</p>
<p>These universally field mysterious, unreguated, greyspace technologies – perfect for pilots seeking a technological edge that few other organizations can provide. They seem to focus on crowd control, individual unit management, and terribly powerful systems.</p>
