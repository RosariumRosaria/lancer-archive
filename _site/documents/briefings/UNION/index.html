<h2>Union, and the Galaxy</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">
To choke the stars with the living.</p>
</p>
    </div>
<h3>The Galaxy at Large</h3>
<p>It is 5016u, and the galaxy is home to trillions. At the core of humanity’s territory there is a golden age, but outside of this newly won utopia the revolutionary project continues.</p>
<h3>Our Union</h3>
<p>Union is a new kind of utopia. A new state – communal and post-capital – for a New Humanity. Union was born from the ashes and ice of the Fall: the collapse that felled Old Humanity, boiling Cradle and withering her colonies entirely. Though it has been thousands of years since Union was founded – and thousands more since the Fall – New Humanity knows only one truth among ten thousand unknowns: if we are to survive, then we must come together in solidarity and mutual aid.</p>
<div class="card">
<p><div class="section-header">
<h2>The Utopian Pillars</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">
For which we Strive</p>
  </p>
    </div>
<p><strong>I. ALL SHALL HAVE THEIR MATERIAL NEEDS FULFILLED</strong></p>
<p>Under Union, it is paramount that all humans be afforded the decency of a life in which their basic needs are met. The state must make food, water, shelter, and just labor available to all, and may never deny those rights. To do so is to violate the most basic of social contracts.</p>
<p><strong>II. NO WALLS SHALL STAND BETWEEN WORLDS.</strong></p>
<p>The void of Interstellar space is deep, cold, and utterly hostile to life. Any civilian world, station, or moon not granted restrictions by Union edict must allow access to any who petition, allowing all to feel firm ground beneath their feet, breathe clean air, and enjoy the light of a life-giving sun (or equivalent, in the case of space Stations or worlds that necessitate artificial light).</p>
<p><strong>III. NO HUMAN SHALL BE HELD IN BONDAGE THROUGH FORCE, LABOR, OR DEBT.</strong></p>
<p>The scarcity of natural resources is a false premise – a myth and a tool used to enrich the few while oppressing the many. The dignity of human life is paramount on all worlds, whether Core or Diasporan. To exploit people and their labor while denying them just compensation is abhorrent.</p>
</div>
<h3>Our Failings</h3>
<p>Despite Union’s conviction – and despite its successes so far – the sheer size of this collective project is daunting. Union is distant to most people: fictionalized in omninet dramas and novels; dreamed about by children and wanderers; hailed as the promised kingdom or damned as the pit by religions across the galaxy.</p>
<p>For all its authority, Union prefers to rule from a distance. Few have ever seen one of Union’s administrators, let alone suffered one of its naval campaigns. For those who have never seen its flag, Union is all but a myth; for those whose skies have been darkened by Union’s ships, the hegemony may have brought liberty – but it brought death first.</p>
<p>Union was not always as egalitarian as it is now; for thousands of years prior to the establishment of the Third Committee, it was an empire in all but name. This was the age of the Second Committee – SecComm.</p>
<p>Under SecComm, Union advanced humanity’s diaspora as a glacier scours the earth, flattening cultures left by Old Humanity, societies built by FirstComm, and all whose interpretation of Union’s founding tenets diverged from SecComm’s dogmatic proscriptions.</p>
